My goal...

Create a view with buttons.

Each button will display a new View, which does a slide transition from right to left.

The second view uses a template file.

The first view would pass a parameter to second view before the transition.

The second view would do a lookup with the parameter, and populate its fields in the template file.

this template file, also has buttons, which will open up a new page that passes a parameter, does another lookup and continues the routine...

There is no Navigation stack as I do not want a back button.

I do not know how many pages will be displayed as the pages are being built dynamically.
